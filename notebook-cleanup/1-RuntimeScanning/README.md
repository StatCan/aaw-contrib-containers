## STILL TODO
Get this thing in DEV (its fine to output to terminal initially)

$JFROG_USERNAME --> username
$JFROG_PASSWORD --> Should be the ENCRYPTED password

1) Need to have https://github.com/StatCan/daaas/issues/960 (possibly Zach has to update something system related)
2) Actually test
3) Test cleaning the remote repository cache (dockerfiles are 10Gb, this could be done in the b-pull.sh)
